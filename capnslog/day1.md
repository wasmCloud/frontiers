# Cap'n's Log

## Day 1

The first entry in the development journal. In this episode I walk through what **wasmCloud Frontiers** is, why we're building it, how we're planning on building it, and I also go through some preliminary game rules.

One of the main goals of the video and wasmCloud Frontiers in general is to give people a fun way to get introduced to wasmCloud and learn wasmCloud fundamentals. I've always believed that the best way to learn things is through gaming--or at least through something entertaining.

### Notes and Apologies

1. I apologize for the distant sounding audio. I am working on getting a legit "podcasting" type microphone.
2. I apologize for the weird aspect ratio. I couldn't get OBS to give me a nice HD ratio while still giving me 80x25 columns of human-readable text in the terminal. I'll work on fixing this before next episode as well.
