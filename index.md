## Experiment
First and foremost, **Frontiers** is an experiment. The hypothesis is that developers who play this game by participating and developing actors and running their own frontiers will learn wasmCloud development techniques, develop muscle memory, and hopefully have some fun along the way.

Frontiers is not meant to be a game played by regular gamers, it is a game _for_ wasmCloud developers _by_ wasmCloud developers.
